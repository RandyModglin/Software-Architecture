Instructions for using the program from the Visual Studio Code Editor

1. Open the Homework 1 folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Go the folder app/src/main/java: These 4 java files are the source code
3. Open the file "KWIC.java" and run it, it should guide you from there

Important Note:
The program says this, but I'm gonna reiterate it here, the program specifically reads .txt files stored in the "Files" Folder. The Folder is in the App Folder.
You don't need to include the file path, but you do need to include the file extension.

The rubric didn't include anything about where I need to take in files from, so I made a call, hopefully I called correctly.
